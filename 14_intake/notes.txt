DISCO:
* the code works as is - doesn't require any comments to be uncommented
* new thing imported from flask!! - request
* form takes user to /auth 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Q/C/C:
* what does ", methods=['GET', 'POST']" do ?
* wouldn't testmod0 not work because its imported?
* what does request from flask do?
* how does testmod0.py work in general
