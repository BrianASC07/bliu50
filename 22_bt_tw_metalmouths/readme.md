DISCO: 
tailwind: (used guide by Cooler Beans)
there's a lot of customization options for tailwind
simpler to use comparied to foundation
compatibility with other frameworks like react
built in adaptibility to screen size and mobile devices

bootstrap: (used guide by jingle)
built in adaptibility to screen size and mobile devices
built in JS to the framework for dropdowns and cool effects


QCC:
tailwind:
paywall access to pre-made components >:(
there is a lack of built in js--needs to be supplemented by yourself or other resources

bootstrap:
are there cases where Bootstrap's CSS and JS conflict with other framworks like React and Vue?
extremely flexible grid system, but a little overkill
although a framework for beginners, the complex grid system can be difficult to debug and use

q1:
I prefer bootstrap over tailwind because it's a bit more simple and intuitive to use and implement while having comparitive quality and options to other frameworks. It's documentation is easy to follow and organized in a way where it's easy to see all the styling options that are available to you. Bootstrap also has much greater compatibility with other frameworks and there are fewer features locked behind a paywall compared to tailwind.
