Predictions:
Once the commented part is uncommented, using the new link would direct the user to foo.html, which would display a random number.

Observations:
When running through flask, "no hablo queso!" is displayed. When using the new link instead of the root directory, "is this plain text, though" is displayed. After uncommenting out the block of code, a randomly generated float is displayed on the page.
