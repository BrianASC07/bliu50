Q: What happens when you access this file
     via
      http://localhost:5000/static/foo 
     ?

When i access the file using the link above instead of the root, the function with the decoder @app.route("/static/foo.html") 
runs instead of the root one.

NOTA BENE:
 Keep yourself honest by
   jotting down or verbalizing
     to your neighbourhood Devos+Duckies your prediction
       --- BEFORE you run your test.
