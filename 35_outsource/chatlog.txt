User: Your team has been contracted to create a collaborative storytelling game/website, with the following features: Users will have to register to use the site. Logged-in users can either start a new story or add to an existing story. When adding to a story, Users are shown only the latest update to the story, not the whole thing. A user can then add some amount of text to the story. Once a user has added to a story, they cannot add to it again. When creating a new story, Users get to start with any amount of text and give the story a title. Logged in users will be able to read any story they have contributed to on their homepage (the landing page after login). Flask will serve as your web server/delivery framework. SQLite3 will serve as your backend data storage system. please provide code for all the components needed for the app to be fully functional and working. the app should run as soon as I copy and paste the code. please also contain files for static, templates, and database. do NOT use any modules or whatever that is not mentioned above or necessary for the project

COPILOT: Sure, here is the complete code for a collaborative storytelling game/website using Flask and SQLite3.

After copying and pasting the provided code into the respective files, you can start the application by running the app.py file using Python. Make sure you have Flask installed in your environment. The application will create the SQLite database automatically on the first run.
